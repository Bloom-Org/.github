## Monetize your content with Smart Posts

Transforming SocialFi into a blockchain-powered revenue stream. Putting creators in control, BLOOM enables post promotion with smart posts, allowing users to mirror posts and earn rewards on Bloom-supported dApps.  

## **Description**

BLOOM on Lens Protocol is transforming the landscape of SocialFi. Empowering content creators, Bloom introduces a dynamic promotion model for smart posts. Creators can set budgets, max-per-share amounts, and minimum follower counts, boosting visibility across all Lens SocialFi dApps. When integrated with the ENS SocialFi dApp, Bloom turns posts into promoted content, visible to a wider audience. Users meeting the minimum follower count can mirror the post, registering for rewards. To prevent abuse, a 3-day buffer period ensures post stability before reward claims via the BLOOM Platform.

BLOOM revolutionizes SocialFi by offering creators unprecedented control over post promotion, ensuring genuine engagement through a secure and transparent blockchain infrastructure. Users benefit from mirrored rewards, and SocialFi dApps experience increased user activity and monetization, creating a thriving, interconnected ecosystem.

BLOOM serves as a catalyst for SocialFi dApps, providing a streamlined avenue for monetization. By incentivizing user engagement through mirrored rewards, Bloom enhances content visibility and user participation. Bloom sustains its ecosystem with a 5% cut from each reward, contributing 50% of this cut to the SocialFi dApp where the user mirrored the post. This innovative revenue-sharing model strengthens partnerships within the decentralized social media space.
